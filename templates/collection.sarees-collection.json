It is a long piece of fabric, typically measuring around 5 to 9 yards in length and 1 to 1.5 yards in width. The saree is draped over a fitted blouse (choli) and a petticoat (underskirt), with the loose end called the pallu gracefully draped over the shoulder.</p><p>Sarees are known for their versatility and timeless elegance. They come in a wide range of fabrics, colors, prints, and embellishments, allowing for endless variations and styles. The drape of a saree accentuates the natural curves of the body, highlighting the femininity of the wearer.</p><p>The versatility of the saree makes it suitable for various events and settings, ranging from casual gatherings to formal ceremonies. It can be worn at weddings, festivals, parties, religious ceremonies, office events, or even as everyday attire, depending on the fabric, design, and styling.</p><h2>Which saree collections do we have at Summer?</h2><p>Here are the other sarees we have in our collection</p><h3>Sarees By Fabric</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/organza-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Organza Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/chiffon-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Chiffon Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/georgette-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Georgette Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/silk-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Silk Sarees</span></a></li></ul><h3>Sarees By Design</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/printed-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Printed Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/embroidered-saree\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Embroidered Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/luxury-saree\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Luxury Sarees</span></a></li></ul><h3>Sarees By Occasion</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/haldi-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Haldi Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/mehendi-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Mehendi Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/engagement-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Engagement Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/reception-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Reception Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/partywear-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Partywear Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/festive-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Festive Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/farewell-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Farewell Sarees</span></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lovesummer.in/collections/diwali-sarees\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Diwali Sarees</span></a></li></ul><h2>Types of Sarees</h2><h3>Here are different types of sarees:<br/><br/><strong>Sarees by Fabrics</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Organza Sarees:</strong>¬†Immerse yourself in sheer enchantment with our Organza Sarees.

Here are some tips on how to choose a saree for different body types:</p><h3>Hourglass Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for sarees with well-defined waistlines to accentuate your curves. Sarees with heavy borders, embellishments, or bold prints can enhance your figure.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Nivi drape or the Mermaid drape to highlight your well-defined waist.</p><h3>Pear-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Choose sarees with lighter fabrics and minimalistic designs for the lower half. Focus on sarees with elaborate or heavily embellished pallus to draw attention upwards.</p><p>Draping Style: Consider the Gujarati drape or the Butterfly drape, which add volume to the shoulder and upper body, balancing the proportions.</p><h3>Apple-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for sarees with lightweight fabrics and soft drapes that don't add extra volume around the waist. Choose sarees with vertical patterns or small prints to create an illusion of length.</p><p>Draping Style: Go for the Seedha Pallu drape or the Bengali drape, which divert attention from the midsection and create a slimming effect.</p><h3>Rectangle-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Choose sarees with textures, bold prints, or horizontal patterns to add curves and create the illusion of a fuller figure. Opt for sarees with wide borders or statement pallus.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Lehenga drape or the Mumtaz drape, which add volume and create the illusion of curves.</p><h3>Petite Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for lightweight fabrics like chiffon, georgette, or organza that drape well and don't overwhelm your frame. Choose sarees with small prints or delicate embroidery.</p><p>Draping Style: Go for the Seedha Pallu drape or the Front Pallu drape, which gives the illusion of height and elongates the body.</p><h3>Tall Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Experiment with a wide range of sarees, including bold prints, large motifs, and heavy borders. Sarees with bold colors and textures can complement your height.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Gujarati drape or the Nivi drape, which showcase the saree beautifully and accentuate your tall frame.</p><p>Remember, these are general guidelines, and personal preference plays a significant role in choosing a saree. Ultimately, wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable, regardless of your body type. Experiment with different draping styles and saree designs to find what suits you best.</p><h2>What accessories can you pair with a saree?</h2><p>When it comes to accessorizing a saree, there are numerous options to enhance your overall look. Here are some accessories that you can pair with a saree:</p><h3>Jewelry</h3><ul><li>Necklaces: Choose a necklace that complements the neckline of your blouse.

Jhumkas, studs, hoops, or danglers can all be great choices.</li><li>Bangles/Bracelets: Stack bangles or wear a statement bracelet on your wrist.

Here are some tips on how to choose a saree for different body types:</p><h3>Hourglass Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for sarees with well-defined waistlines to accentuate your curves. Sarees with heavy borders, embellishments, or bold prints can enhance your figure.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Nivi drape or the Mermaid drape to highlight your well-defined waist.</p><h3>Pear-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Choose sarees with lighter fabrics and minimalistic designs for the lower half. Focus on sarees with elaborate or heavily embellished pallus to draw attention upwards.</p><p>Draping Style: Consider the Gujarati drape or the Butterfly drape, which add volume to the shoulder and upper body, balancing the proportions.</p><h3>Apple-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for sarees with lightweight fabrics and soft drapes that don't add extra volume around the waist. Choose sarees with vertical patterns or small prints to create an illusion of length.</p><p>Draping Style: Go for the Seedha Pallu drape or the Bengali drape, which divert attention from the midsection and create a slimming effect.</p><h3>Rectangle-shaped Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Choose sarees with textures, bold prints, or horizontal patterns to add curves and create the illusion of a fuller figure. Opt for sarees with wide borders or statement pallus.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Lehenga drape or the Mumtaz drape, which add volume and create the illusion of curves.</p><h3>Petite Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Opt for lightweight fabrics like chiffon, georgette, or organza that drape well and don't overwhelm your frame. Choose sarees with small prints or delicate embroidery.</p><p>Draping Style: Go for the Seedha Pallu drape or the Front Pallu drape, which gives the illusion of height and elongates the body.</p><h3>Tall Body Type</h3><p>Saree Choice: Experiment with a wide range of sarees, including bold prints, large motifs, and heavy borders. Sarees with bold colors and textures can complement your height.</p><p>Draping Style: Try the Gujarati drape or the Nivi drape, which showcase the saree beautifully and accentuate your tall frame.</p><p>Remember, these are general guidelines, and personal preference plays a significant role in choosing a saree. Ultimately, wear what makes you feel confident and comfortable, regardless of your body type. Experiment with different draping styles and saree designs to find what suits you best.</p>"
